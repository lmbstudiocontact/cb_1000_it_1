    "A largescale analysis of both oral and written texts showed that nouns and verbs differed in the rhythmic contexts in which they typically occur.",
    "Most of the recurring verbs (have, do, make) do not establish useful selectional preferences, and most of the noun phrases are actually semantically weak pronouns.",
    "Also, most single word utterances addressed to the target-child consisted of a noun.",
    "The discrepancy in the number of different nouns across children was expected since the number of utterances produced varied for each child across samples.",
    "This account might receive further support if the verbs actually attested with habitual do tended to have action nouns based on them.",
    "Solid vertical line indicates mean offset of target noun (533 ms).",
    "The overall conclusion is then that from both the phonological and morphological perspective, adjectives behave very much like nouns but unlike verbs.",
    "The first is that the noun in this construction already has some of the semantics of an ordinary verb."
