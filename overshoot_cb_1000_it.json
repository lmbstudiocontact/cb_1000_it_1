    "Failure is not due to overshooting the target (as in superset errors), since the strategy of maximum retrenchment entailed by (dk) prevents that.",

    "First, what conditions, in terms of investment, demographic, and economic parameters, make a developing economy more or less prone to population overshoot and resource collapse?",
    "This bias results in a systematic range error; that is, the eyes tend to overshoot close targets and undershoot more distant targets.",
    "At higher forward momenta (vertical stripes), trajectories overshoot the standing position and lead to a forward fall.",
    "Because of this the potential for overshoot is always present and cannot be avoided unless the system is severely overdamped."
