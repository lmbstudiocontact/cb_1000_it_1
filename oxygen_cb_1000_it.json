    "Five days later, following extubation, the saturations were 86-88% in 50% facial oxygen.",
    "Thus, it appears that at least a few species of methanogens can tolerate atmospheric oxygen for relatively extended periods of time.",
    "We note that since (2.20), the equation for oxygen tension, is quasi-steady, small jumps in the oxygen tension may appear between consecutive timesteps.",
    "This effect allows oxygen to be released from the molecule at venous oxygen pressure.",
    "In each case, inversion of configuration was demonstrated using thio-substituted non-bridging phosphate oxygens.",
    "An improvement in uptake of peak level of oxygen was observed after intervention."
